# Statistical Analysis of 2024 Election Polling Data

The following GitHub repository was prepared by Robert Feldstein, working in conjunction with Professor Joe Guinness at Cornell University. 

We worked on answering the following questions:

1. What is the difference between favorability and approval?
2. How do liberal voters differ from Biden voters? How do conservative voters differ from Trump voters?
3. Can we predict spread (difference in polling between two candidates) based on the type of voter? (i.e. LV vs. RV)

We hope this repository can serve as a jumping off point for other users seeking to answer election related questions. 

In this repository we utilize code which scrapes data from RealClearPolitics. **We do not condone mass scraping of data from polling platforms.** Please utilize commands like time.sleep()
to help limit strain on servers.

Thank you!
