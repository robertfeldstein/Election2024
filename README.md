# Statistical Analysis of 2024 Election Polling Data

The following GitHub repository was prepared by Robert Feldstein, working in conjunction with Professor Joe Guinness at Cornell University. 

We worked primarily on modeling the spread in polling between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. In particular, we investigated whether or not linear regression and brownian motion models could accurately model the state of public opinion. We were also interested in how real-time betting markets related to future polling. 

We hope this repository can serve as a jumping off point for other users seeking to perform statistical analysis on polling data. 

In this repository we utilize code which scrapes data from RealClearPolitics. **We do not condone mass scraping of data from polling platforms.** Please utilize commands like time.sleep()
to help limit strain on servers.

Thank you!
